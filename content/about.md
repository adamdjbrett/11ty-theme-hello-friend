# Hi there

My name is Radek and I'm the author of this theme. I made it to help you present your ideas easier.

We all know how hard it is to start something on the web, especially these days. You need to prepare a bunch of stuff, configure it, and then create the content.

This theme is pretty basic and covers all of the essentials. All you have to do is start typing.

The theme includes:

- light/dark mode, depending on your preferences
- great reading experience thanks to [Inter UI font](https://rsms.me/inter/)
- nice code highlighting thanks to [PrismJS](https://prismjs.com)

So, there you have it. Enjoy.
